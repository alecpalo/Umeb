                                UMEB provides a large amount of flexibility on a weekly basis. We ask that you at least attend our weekly one hour general meetings as well as a subteam meeting during the week, but you can contribute as little or as much as you want beyond that.

                                While you are not required to attend every meeting, it is important to not miss them frequently. Meetings are a chance to be updated on what different sub teams are working on as well as catch up with club members.

                                Of course! As a student organization, we prioritize member education and growth first. You may work with as many sub teams as you choose. We also have no qualms about members joining other project teams.
