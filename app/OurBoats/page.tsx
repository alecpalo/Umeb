                            TiDE is the most ambitious design that UMEB has undertaken. The craft will feature a 22 foot deep tunnel racing hull equipped with a full control system and custom-designed battery packs. These battery packs will have 69 kWh of capacity, 814 volts of peak voltage, and a lightweight design. TiDE will be powered by a 430 kW (575 horsepower) electric axial flux motor coupled with an overdrive arneson system.

                            Unfortunately, Snowfinkle was not seaworthy in time for the 2023 Promoting Electric Propulsion. Instead of traveling empty handed, we built the Parmar. While it does not showcase our intended design, it does demonstrate the innovation and dedication our engineering team
                            had. The Parmar raced over 3.5 miles, a mile for every day we spent manufacturing the craft.

                            Snowfinkle is a next generation racing craft, utilizing hydrofoil technology to lift the boat out of the water and achieve flight. Powered by two 41 horsepower DHX motors submerged underwater in custom-built aluminum propulsion pods, Snowfinkle can reach top speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. The 17 foot winged vessel glides through the water, remotely piloted and stabilized by a passive control system as well as active control surfaces on the foils themselves.

                            Proteus was where it all began for UMEB. The 17-ft catamaran hull was repurposed from the 2016 Rio Olympics, and the 1970â€™s-era outboard motor was converted to run on electric power. The powertrain ran on a 72V Li-FePo4 battery with a DHX motor producing 31 hp, enabling Proteus to sustain speeds of 12mph for up to 5 miles.

                            Despite the COVID lockdown and limited workspace, the team persevered and decided to build Proteus outdoors, braving harsh weather conditions, including snow, rain, and summer heat.

                            Proteus finished second at the 2021 Promoting Electric Propulsion completion. This was an impressive feat given that it was UMEB&apos;s first time participating in any competition. Proteus will always hold a special place in the team&apos;s hearts as a testament to our hard work and dedication to our craft.
